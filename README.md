# From Bytes to Beats: Music Generation Using WGAN-GP and Self-Attention Mechanism

This repository contains the implementation of a music generation model using Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP), enhanced with a self-attention mechanism designed to create melodic compositions. 

## Project Overview

This project aims to explore the capabilities of GANs in the realm of music generation. Utilizing the Lakh Pianoroll Dataset, the model applies advanced techniques such as Wasserstein GANs with Gradient Penalty (WGAN-GP) to generate high-quality and coherent musical sequences.

## Dataset

The Lakh Pianoroll Dataset is used for training the model, which provides a rich collection of MIDI files suitable for training music generation models. More information about the dataset can be found [here](https://salu133445.github.io/lakh-pianoroll-dataset/).
